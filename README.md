Online server/client application where players can host game rooms to play Omok. Omok is a board game. The exectable program  for the client and server is included.

### How to compile
The Boost ASIO library is required to compile the server and client. Include all source files in the compilation target and the required target libraries. The compilation command used on my computer with MinGW is in compile.bat.
